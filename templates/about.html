        <h1>Disease Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>

        <p>
            Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is a system which predicts the disease based on the information provided by the user. It also predicts the disease of the patient or the user based on the information or the symptoms he/she enters into the system and provides accurate results based on that information. If the patient is not too serious and the user just wants to know the type of disease, they have been through.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nowadays, the health industry plays a major role in curing diseases of patients. This system provides assistance to the health industry by telling the user the type of disease they are suffering from, without having to go to the hospital or any other clinics. By entering the symptoms and other useful information, the user can get to know the disease they are suffering from. This system benefits the health industry by quickly diagnosing diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
        </p>

        <p>
            The successful treatment is always attributed to accurate diagnosis. Doctors may sometimes fail to make accurate decisions while diagnosing a disease. Therefore, disease prediction systems that use machine learning algorithms assist in providing accurate results in such cases.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to research, 70% of people in India suffer from general diseases, and 25% of people face death due to early ignorance. The main motive behind developing this project is to allow users to have a health check-up from the comfort of their own homes.
